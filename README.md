# Wordle_solver
This is a tool for solving the game wordle (https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). 

All the code is one python file. The main tools are create_master, which produces a tree of nested dicts saveable as a json and main, which loads html_mastretree.json and uses it to play wordle interactively
